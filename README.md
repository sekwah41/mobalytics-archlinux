Partially based on [Exaxoda's version](https://github.com/emaxoda/mobalytics-archlinux)

This package was made at the request of this ticket https://github.com/sekwah41/mobalytics-repackager/issues/36.

I am unsure if I can upload this to the AUR or not depending on licensing though will look into it.
